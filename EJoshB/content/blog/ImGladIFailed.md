# Reflecting on my non-medal performance

Last July I was able to compete at the 65th IMO held in the UK as PHI1, which was a lot of fun. Being at the lectures, hanging out with my team, thinking about the problems *after the test*, and being in the community that I had dreamed of being in since I was like 11 was surreal to me. That being said I get to the test with no sleep on the first day but prepared on the next and my score ended up being 5/0/0 7/0/0, a full solve meaning I guaranteed myself an HM but 4 points away from a total that would have garnered me a medal, and this was perhaps the best result I could have asked for.

On a different day could I have gotten a silver or maybe even a gold? Yes, we all could’ve. I mean it’s the IMO, everyone’s unreasonably good at doing these fun little puzzles they put on the tests. That being said I don’t think I would’ve wanted to. And it took me a good while to come to truly come to terms with the fact that it would not have done me any better to have gotten a silver because of luck. 

For one, it fixed the way I thought about doing math. In particular, it removed the nagging voice in the back of my head that I had to get a medal or the time I spent doing math would be worthless. I think this was made significantly worse by the fact that people online keep talking about how Olympiad math isn’t ‘real’ math, which has some truth to it but is incredibly demoralizing. Getting *only* an HM at the **IMO** was a bittersweet reminder to me of everything that I had done leading up to this point. All the random competitions, dealing with the mess that is the Philippine math contest scene, practicing day in and day out, and how lucky I was to do all that.

The day after the contest, knowing I probably wasn’t going to get a medal, I just picked up where I left off and started doing problems for the fun of it and because I felt excited to do so. I even stayed up til 1 am on one of the days writing up this solution to [2021 ISL G4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHVTUZ4htq4GztjaRCRu0I2N7vMwvP51/view?usp=sharing) for no good reason other than I felt like it. On one of the days me and my team obsessed over this ~~dumb~~ fun puzzle where we wanted to figure out why a loop with this toy that was given to us for free only “flattened” when the number of pieces was 0 mod 4.

Not getting a medal also motivated me to work more to be productive instead of out of interest. Prior to this I had mostly been working on problems for fun or whenever I felt like it. The way I went about my life was not particularly optimized, heck it wasn’t even good, but it worked simply because I had fun doing math and I had fun winning. Including this IMO, I have only ever not won a medal (or placed highly) in a math contest twice in my entire (not so long) life, barring like an IGO I once sat having recently broken my ankle. I felt like I could do no wrong. In the first and only international science competition I joined (IMSO) I got my country’s only gold. The first time I competed in my country’s [national informatics olympiad]() having barely practiced and not even knowing how to do C++ I had gotten a 6th place with 4/8 problems solved and a two 4000 peso checks for getting “best rookie of the year.”

Coasting became especially easy during the pandemic but past that things have begun to break down for me. I started doing worse on certain school subjects, I couldn’t keep a new hobby if I tried, and to end the year I got an HM rather than the medal I had hoped for. There have been many points in my life where I had given to complacency because I was good with the position I was in, and that was made worse by the fact that I never felt like I really had to try harder than felt comfortable. A few days after I had flown back from the IMO I was reading [essay from Evan Chen](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) which quoted [Dr. Zuming Feng](https://youtu.be/cVlR-5hS6f4?si=GRgURbKv6gaEugpz&t=844) saying “I really want you to work hard, but I really think if you don’t do well, if you fail, it’s better for you” and everything started to click for me. The sign to actually bunker down and get to where I wanted to be, and I guess this essay and by extension this website is a result of that.

Overall I’ve loved the entire experience I’ve had this year leading up to the IMO and being at the IMO itself. Making a lot of friends (for me at least), enjoying a bunch of cool math problems, and learning to push myself to do things that I’ve wanted to for ages. I’ve only ever cried at failure because of expectations and what not, so it’s refreshing to be optimistic and motivated after one. Although, I do admit how overly full of myself it must sound from the outside to call making it to the IMO a failure, but in a lot of ways it was to me, but I’m glad I decided to call it a failure.
